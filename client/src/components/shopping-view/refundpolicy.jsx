            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-4">2.1 Products eligible</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>A product may be eligible for a refund or exchange only if it is defective, damaged during delivery, or incorrect (i.e., you received a wrong product compared to what you ordered).</li>
              <li>Because we deal in medical and health-related products, refunds will not be offered for simply "change of mind", "no longer needed", or "found cheaper elsewhere", except where required by applicable law.</li>
              <li>All requests for refund or exchange must be submitted within 24 hours of delivery (or longer if local law mandates).</li>
              <li>To be eligible for a refund or exchange the product must be unused (unless the defect is such that usage is impossible) and in the same condition and packaging as when delivered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-4">2.2 Products not eligible</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Opened, used, or partially consumed health products, medicines, or supplements that cannot be restocked for safety reasons.</li>
              <li>Products whose expiry date has passed or which have been tampered with.</li>
              <li>Digital or downloadable products (if offered) once the download or activation has taken place.</li>
              <li>Products clearly marked as "non-refundable" at the time of purchase.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>If the refund/exchange claim is due to our error (wrong product shipped, damaged in transit, manufacturer defect), we will cover the return shipping cost.</li>
              <li>If you request a return for any reason not caused by us (which we typically do not accept for medicines), you may be responsible for shipping costs and any risk in transit.</li>
              <li>Until the returned product is received and inspected, we cannot guarantee a refund or exchange.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Once we receive and inspect the returned product (if applicable) and determine your claim is valid, we will issue a refund to your original method of payment or offer an exchange or credit note (in our discretion).</li>
              <li>The refund will exclude any shipping fee you paid.</li>
              <li>It may take 5-10 business days for the refund to appear in your account, depending on your bank or payment provider.</li>
              <li>If the product was delivered free of shipping cost on our end, shipping may be deducted as permitted by applicable law.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>If you wish to exchange a defective or wrong item for the same product (if available), we will endeavour to dispatch the replacement promptly once we approve your claim.</li>
              <li>If the product you originally ordered is no longer available, we may offer you a similar product of equal value, a refund or credit note.</li>
            </ul>

          </div>

            <p>
              If you haven't received a refund yet, first check your bank account or payment method. Then contact your payment provider—it may take some time. If still not received, contact us at medicrossremedies@gmail.com and we will investigate.
